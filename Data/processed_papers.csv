Recent advances in ammonia synthesis technologies: Toward future zero carbon emissions,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.09.061,"As a carbon-free molecule, ammonia has gained great global interest in being considered a significant future candidate for the transition toward renewable energy. Numerous applications of ammonia as a fuel have been developed for energy generation, heavy transportation, and clean, distributed energy storage. There is a clear global target to achieve a sustainable economy and carbon neutrality. Therefore, most of the research's efforts are concentrated on generating cost-effective renewable energy on a large scale rather than fossil fuels. However, storage and transportation are still roadblocks for these technologies, for example, hydrogen technologies. Ammonia could be replaced as a viable fuel for a clean and sustainable future of global energy. More efforts from governments and scientists can lead to making ammonia a clean energy vector in most energy applications. In this review, ammonia synthesis was assessed, including conventional Haber_Bosch technology. Current hydrogen technologies as the key parameters for ammonia generation are also evaluated. The role of ammonia as a hydrogen-based fuel and generation roadmap are discussed for future utilization of energy mix. Further, ammonia generation processes are addressed in depth, including blue and green ammonia generation. A survey of ammonia synthesis catalytic materials was conducted and the role of catalyst materials in ammonia generation was compared, which showed that the Ru-based catalyst generated the maximum ammonia after 20 h of starting experiment. An end-use plan for using ammonia as a clean energy fuel in vehicles, marines, gas turbines as well as fuel cells, is briefly discussed to recognize the potential applications of ammonia use. The practical and future end-use vision of energy sources is proposed to achieve great benefits at low carbon emissions and costs.

Co doping regulating electronic structure of Bi2MoO6 to construct dual active sites for photocatalytic nitrogen fixation,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apcatb.2023.123057,"A B S T R A C T Although photocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (PNRR) is a green ammonia synthesis technology, it still encounters low adsorption/activation efficiency of N2 and lack of reaction active sites. Element doping is an efficient strategy to regulate electronic structure of catalyst. Nevertheless, the mechanism of the effect of doping elements on the N2 adsorption/activation, reaction active site and energy barriers is not well unraveled. Taking Co doped Bi2MoO6 (Co-Bi2MoO6) as a model photocatalyst, density functional theory (DFT) and experiment study were used to investigate the mechanism of Co doping on the PNRR performance over Bi2MoO6. DFT results reveal that Co doping regulates the electronic structure, activates Bi sites of Co-Bi2MoO6 and provides new Co active sites, thus constructing dual active sites for PNRR. Benefited from dual active sites for effectively adsorption/activation N2, the as-fabricated 3% Co-Bi2MoO6 exhibit the maximum NH3 generation rate of 95.5 Î¼mol__ 1__ 1 without sacrificial agents, which is 7.2 times that of Bi2MoO6. Furthermore, the detail mechanism of N--N bond adsorption/activation and hydrogenation reaction on Co-Bi2MoO6 was also proposed according to in-situ FTIR and DFT results.

"A Prompt Decarbonization Pathway for Shipping: Green Hydrogen, Ammonia, and Methanol Production and Utilization in Marine Engines",http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos14030584,"The shipping industry has reached a higher level of maturity in terms of its knowledge and awareness of decarbonization challenges. Carbon-free or carbon-neutralized green fuel, such as green hydrogen, green ammonia, and green methanol, are being widely discussed. However, little attention has paid to the green fuel pathway from renewable energy to shipping. This paper, therefore, provides a review of the production methods for green power (green hydrogen, green ammonia, and green methanol) and analyzes the potential of green fuel for application to shipping. The review shows that the potential production methods for green hydrogen, green ammonia, and green methanol for the shipping industry are (1) hydrogen production from seawater electrolysis using green power; (2) ammonia production from green hydrogen + Haber-Bosch process; and (3) methanol production from CO2 using green power. While the future of green fuel is bright, in the short term, the costs are expected to be higher than conventional fuel. Our recommendations are therefore as follows: improve green power production technology to reduce the production cost; develop electrochemical fuel production technology to increase the efficiency of green fuel production; and explore new technology. Strengthening the research and development of renewable energy and green fuel production technology and expanding fuel production capacity to ensure an adequate supply of low- and zero-emission marine fuel are important factors to achieve carbon reduction in shipping.",shipping industry reach high level maturity term knowledge awareness decarbonization challenge carbonfree carbonneutralize green fuel green hydrogen green ammonia green methanol widely discuss little attention pay green fuel pathway renewable energy ship paper provide review production method green power green hydrogen green ammonia green methanol analyze potential green fuel application ship review potential production method green hydrogen green ammonia green methanol shipping industry 1 hydrogen production seawater electrolysis use green power 2 ammonia production green hydrogen haberbosch process 3 methanol production co2 use green power future green fuel bright short term cost expect high conventional fuel recommendation follow improve green power production technology reduce production cost develop electrochemical fuel production technology increase efficiency green fuel production explore new technology strengthen research development renewable energy green fuel production technology expand fuel production capacity ensure adequate supply low zeroemission marine fuel important factor achieve carbon reduction shipping
Utilization of green ammonia as a hydrogen energy carrier for decarbonization in spark ignition engines,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.04.073,"AbRising concerns about the dependence of modern energy systems on fossil fuels have raised the requirement for green alternate fuels to pave the roadmap for a sustainable energy future with a carbon-free economy. Massive expectations of hydrogen as an enabler for decarbonization of the energy sector are limited by the lack of required infrastructure, whose implementation is affected by the issues related to the storage and distribution of hydrogen energy. Ammonia is an effective hydrogen energy carrier with a well-established and mature infrastructure for long-distance transportation and distribution. The possibility for green ammonia production from renewable energy sources has made it a suitable green alternate fuel for the decarbonization of the automotive and power generation sectors. In this work, engine characteristics for ammonia combustion in spark ignition engines have been reported with a detailed note on engines fuelled with pure ammonia as well as blends of ammonia with gasoline, hydrogen, and methane. Higher auto-ignition temperature, low flammability, and lower flame speed of ammonia have a detrimental effect on engine characteristics, and it could be addressed either by incorporating engine modifications or by enhancing the fuel quality. Literature shows that the increase in compression ratio from 9.4:1 to 11.5:1 improved the maximum power by 59% and the addition of 10% hydrogen in supercharged conditions improved the indicated efficiency by 37%.

Techno-economic assessment of green hydrogen and ammonia production from wind and solar energy in Iran,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.12.285,"This paper presents a comprehensive technical and economic assessment of potential green hydrogen and ammonia production plants in different locations in Iran with strong wind and solar resources. The study was organized in five steps. First, regarding the wind density and solar PV potential data, three locations in Iran were chosen with the highest wind power, solar radiation, and a combination of both wind/solar energy. All these locations are inland spots, but since the produced ammonia is planned to be exported, it must be transported to the export harbor in the South of Iran. For comparison, a base case was also considered next to the export harbor with normal solar and wind potential, but no distance from the export harbor. In the second step, a similar large-scale hydrogen production facility with proton exchange membrane electrolyzers was modeled for all these locations using the HOMER Pro simulation platform. In the next step, the produced hydrogen and the nitrogen obtained from an air separation unit are supplied to a Haber-Bosch process to synthesize ammonia as a hydrogen carrier. Since water electrolysis requires a considerable amount of water with specific quality and because Iran suffers from water scarcity, this paper, unlike many similar research studies, addresses the challenges associated with the water supply system in the hydrogen production process. In this regard, in the fourth step of this study, it is assumed that seawater from the nearest sea is treated in a desalination plant and sent to the site locations. Finally, since this study intends to evaluate the possibility of green hydrogen export from Iran, a detailed piping model for the transportation of water, hydrogen, and ammonia from/to the production site and the export harbor is created in the last step, which considers the real routs using satellite images, and takes into account all pump/compression stations required to transport these media. This study provides a realistic cost of green hydrogen/ammonia production in Iran, which is ready to be exported, considering all related processes involved in the hydrogen supply chain.",paper present comprehensive technical economic assessment potential green hydrogen ammonia production plant different location iran strong wind solar resource study organize step regard wind density solar pv potential datum location iran choose high wind power solar radiation combination windsolar energy location inland spot produce ammonia plan export transport export harbor south iran comparison base case consider export harbor normal solar wind potential distance export harbor second step similar largescale hydrogen production facility proton exchange membrane electrolyzer model location use homer pro simulation platform step produce hydrogen nitrogen obtain air separation unit supply haberbosch process synthesize ammonia hydrogen carrier water electrolysis require considerable water specific quality iran suffer water scarcity paper unlike similar research study address challenge associate water supply system hydrogen production process regard fourth step study assume seawater near sea treat desalination plant send site location finally study intend evaluate possibility green hydrogen export iran detail pipe model transportation water hydrogen ammonia fromto production site export harbor create step consider real rout use satellite image account pumpcompression station require transport medium study provide realistic cost green hydrogenammonia production iran ready export consider relate process involve hydrogen supply chain

"A Perspective on the Overarching Role of Hydrogen, Ammonia, and Methanol Carbon-Neutral Fuels towards Net Zero Emission in the Next Three Decades",http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en16010280,"Arguably, one of the most important issues the world is facing currently is climate change. At the current rate of fossil fuel consumption, the world is heading towards extreme levels of global temperature rise if immediate actions are not taken. Transforming the current energy system from one largely based on fossil fuels to a carbon-neutral one requires unprecedented speed. Based on the current state of development, direct electrification of the future energy system alone is technically challenging and not enough, especially in hard-to-abate sectors like heavy industry, road trucking, international shipping, and aviation. This leaves a considerable demand for alternative carbon-neutral fuels such as green ammonia and hydrogen and renewable methanol. From this perspective, we discuss the overarching roles of each fuel in reaching net zero emission within the next three decades.

The economics of global green ammonia trade - Shipping Australian wind and sunshine to Germany,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2023.120662,"This paper contributes to understanding the transformation of global energy trade to green energy carriers, focusing on green ammonia as the foreseeable first green hydrogen carrier. We provide a comprehensive overview of today's ammonia trade and assess scaling options for the trade of green ammonia. To that aim, we develop an optimization model for the integrated assessment of the green ammonia value chain that covers all steps from green ammonia production in an exporting country, up to delivery to a harbor in an importing country. The model endogenously chooses among different technology options and determines cost minimal operation. In a case study, we apply the model to the large-scale import of ammonia from Australia to Germany in a scenario for 2030. The results show that green ammonia can reach cost parity with gray ammonia even for moderate gas prices (but not necessarily with blue ammonia) if CO2 prices are high enough. We also provide a sensitivity analysis with respect to the interest rate and other key technical and economic parameters and show that cracking ammonia to provide pure hydrogen comes at a 45 % cost markup per MWh at the destination.",paper contribute understand transformation global energy trade green energy carrier focus green ammonia foreseeable green hydrogen carrier provide comprehensive overview today ammonia trade assess scaling option trade green ammonia aim develop optimization model integrate assessment green ammonia value chain cover step green ammonia production export country delivery harbor import country model endogenously choose different technology option determine cost minimal operation case study apply model largescale import ammonia australia germany scenario 2030 result green ammonia reach cost parity gray ammonia moderate gas price necessarily blue ammonia co2 price high provide sensitivity analysis respect interest rate key technical economic parameter crack ammonia provide pure hydrogen come 45 cost markup mwh destination
Techno-economic evaluation of hydrogen and ammonia as energy carriers in a multi-generation system,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2023.116670,"Green hydrogen is suitable for grid-scale energy storage to increase the penetration of renewable energy, and it is also an alternative to fossil fuels. However, it still suffers from storage problems owing to its low volumetric energy density, embrittlement, and very low boiling point. To improve safety and reduce cost, green ammonia has been proposed as a substitute for hydrogen and has attracted considerable attention. In this study, a multi-generation system was proposed to compare green hydrogen and green ammonia as energy carriers. Four scenarios are discussed and the performances under different energy carriers, constant and time-of-use electricity prices, and on-grid and off-grid operations are compared. The optimal planning of the system was formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming problem and was evaluated using supply and demand profiles hourly over a year. The objective was to maximize profitability, which is reflected by the cumulative cash position and payback period. The results revealed that the hydrogen-based system was superior to the ammonia-based system. In the hydrogen-based scenario, the cumulative cash position was 83.43 MUSD and the payback period was 14 years. The cumulative cash position and payback period were 12.78 MUSD and 22 years, respectively, in the ammonia-based scenario.

Potential-Driven Restructuring of Cu Single Atoms to Nanoparticles for Boosting the Electrochemical Reduction of Nitrate to Ammonia,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.2c02262,"Restructuring is ubiquitous in thermocatalysis and of pivotal importance to identify the real active site, yet it is less explored in electrocatalysis. Herein, by using operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy in conjunction with advanced electron microscopy, we reveal the restructuring of the as-synthesized CuN4 single-atom site to the nanoparticles of _5 nm during the electrochemical reduction of nitrate to ammonia, a green ammonia production route upon combined with the plasma-assisted oxidation of nitrogen. The reduction of Cu2+ to Cu+ and Cu0 and the subsequent aggregation of Cu0 single atoms is found to occur concurrently with the enhancement of the NH3 production rate, both of them are driven by the applied potential switching from 0.00 to _1.00 V versus RHE. The maximum production rate of ammonia reaches 4.5 mg cm_2 h_1 (12.5 molNH3 gCu_1 h_1) with a Faradaic efficiency of 84.7% at _1.00 V versus RHE, outperforming most of the other Cu catalysts reported previously. After electrolysis, the aggregated Cu nanoparticles are reversibly disintegrated into single atoms and then restored to the Cu__4 structure upon being exposed to an ambient atmosphere, which masks the potential-induced restructuring during the reaction. The synchronous changes of the Cu0 percentage and the ammonia Faradaic efficiency with the applied potential suggests that the Cu nanoparticles are the genuine active sites for nitrate reduction to ammonia, which is corroborated with both the post-deposited Cu NP catalyst and density functional theory calculations.",restructure ubiquitous thermocatalysis pivotal importance identify real active site explore electrocatalysis use operando xray absorption spectroscopy conjunction advanced electron microscopy reveal restructuring assynthesize cun4 singleatom site nanoparticle 5 nm electrochemical reduction nitrate ammonia green ammonia production route combine plasmaassiste oxidation nitrogen reduction cu2 cu cu0 subsequent aggregation cu0 single atom find occur concurrently enhancement nh3 production rate drive apply potential switch 000 100 v versus rhe maximum production rate ammonia reach 45 mg cm2 h1 125 molnh3 gcu1 h1 faradaic efficiency 847 100 v versus rhe outperforming cu catalyst report previously electrolysis aggregate cu nanoparticle reversibly disintegrate single atom restore cu4 structure expose ambient atmosphere mask potentialinduce restructuring reaction synchronous change cu0 percentage ammonia faradaic efficiency apply potential suggest cu nanoparticle genuine active site nitrate reduction ammonia corroborate postdeposite cu np catalyst density functional theory calculation

Assessing new transmission and energy storage in achieving increasing renewable generation targets in a regional grid,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.05.066,"This study evaluates generation, transmission, and storage capacity needs to achieve deep renewable energy penetration in a regional electricity grid with an average load of approximately 20 GW. Increasing renewable energy targets are analyzed to evaluate the effects of realistic regional transmission upgrade and energy storage cost assumptions on the cost-optimal mix of generation, transmission, and storage capacity. Contextual data is used for New York State¡¯s grid to examine how electricity generation from renewable energy resources (wind, water, and solar power) can meet between 50% and 80% of electricity demand. A central finding of the study is that when realistic transmission upgrade costs are assumed, new interzonal transmission and battery storage are not needed to cost effectively meet near-term renewable energy goals. In fact, New York can achieve 50% renewable energy penetration with only a buildout of new generation capacity: Onshore wind (13.7 GW), offshore wind (4.1 GW), and solar photovoltaics (3 GW). The presence of grid-scale battery storage, electric vehicles, or additional behind-the-meter solar capacity does not markedly change the model-selected generation mix. To achieve the 50% target, we compute a $52/MWh levelized cost of electricity for new renewable energy, which is in line with current generation costs.As the renewable generation target increases beyond 50%, the model begins to select transmission upgrades and new storage capacity, the latter particularly if battery costs continue to decline as anticipated. At deeper targets, marginal generation capacity would otherwise experience high curtailment primarily due to supply_demand imbalances; we calculate the value of energy storage at a 65% renewable energy penetration level to be 2.5_3 times higher than its value at a 50% level. However, the additional storage and generation _ and transmission, to a lesser degree _ needed to achieve longer-term renewable energy goals lead to a substantial rise in total investment. Between 50% and 55% targets, the computed marginal levelized cost of electricity for new variable renewable energy is $94/MWh, compared to $592/MWh between 75% and 80%, suggesting alternative integration measures are likely necessary at such high penetration rates.",study evaluate generation transmission storage capacity need achieve deep renewable energy penetration regional electricity grid average load approximately 20 gw increase renewable energy target analyze evaluate effect realistic regional transmission upgrade energy storage cost assumption costoptimal mix generation transmission storage capacity contextual datum use new york state¡¯s grid examine electricity generation renewable energy resource wind water solar power meet 50 80 electricity demand central finding study realistic transmission upgrade cost assume new interzonal transmission battery storage need cost effectively meet nearterm renewable energy goal fact new york achieve 50 renewable energy penetration buildout new generation capacity onshore wind 137 gw offshore wind 41 gw solar photovoltaic 3 gw presence gridscale battery storage electric vehicle additional behindthemeter solar capacity markedly change modelselecte generation mix achieve 50 target compute 52mwh levelize cost electricity new renewable energy line current generation costsa renewable generation target increase 50 model begin select transmission upgrade new storage capacity particularly battery cost continue decline anticipate deep target marginal generation capacity experience high curtailment primarily supplydemand imbalance calculate value energy storage 65 renewable energy penetration level 253 time high value 50 level additional storage generation transmission degree need achieve longerterm renewable energy goal lead substantial rise total investment 50 55 target compute marginal levelize cost electricity new variable renewable energy 94mwh compare 592mwh 75 80 suggest alternative integration measure likely necessary high penetration rate

Many cell SoC balancing strategies have been proposed; however, control complexity and slow SoC convergence remain as key issues. This paper presents two strategies to achieve SoC balancing among cells: main balancing strategy (MBS) using a cascaded hybrid modular multi-level converter (CHMMC) and a supplementary balancing strategy (SBS) using a cascaded parallel modular dual L-bridge (CPMDLB). The control and monitoring of individual cells with a reduction in the component count and the losses of BESS are achieved by integrating each individual cell into an L-bridge instead of an H-bridge. The simulation results demonstrate a satisfactory performance of the proposed SoC balancing strategy. In this result, SoC balancing convergence point for the cells/modules is achieved at 1000 min when cell-prioritized MBS-CHMMC works without SBS-CPMDLB and at 216.7 min when CPMBS-CHMMC works together with SBS-CPMDLB and when the duration required reduces by 78.33 %.

Early prediction of battery degradation in grid-scale battery energy storage system using extreme gradient boosting algorithm,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rineng.2023.101709,"A B S T R A C T The growth of battery energy storage systems (BESS) is caused by the variability and intermittent nature of high demand and renewable power generation at the network scale. In the context of BESS, Lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery occupies a crucial position, although it is faced with challenges related to performance battery degradation over time due to electrochemical processes. This battery degradation is a crucial factor to account for, based on its potential to diminish the efficiency and safety of electrical system equipment, thereby contributing to increased system planning costs. This implies that the health of battery needs to be diagnosed, particularly by determining remaining useful life (RUL), to avoid unexpected operational costs and ensure system safety. Therefore, this study aimed to use machine learning models, specifically extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithm, to estimate RUL, with a focus on the temperature variable, an aspect that had been previously underemphasized. Utilizing XGBoost model, along with fine-tuning its hyperparameters, proved to be a more accurate and efficient method for predicting RUL. The evaluation of the model yielded promising outcomes, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 90.1 and a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 7.5 %.

Optimal day-ahead large-scale battery dispatch model for multi-regulation participation considering full timescale uncertainties,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2023.113963,"Grid scale battery integration plays an important role in renewable energy integration and the formation of smart grid. To mitigate the problems of insufficient frequency response and peak regulation capacities faced by modern power grids with high wind energy uptake, a day-ahead optimization dispatch strategy considering operational risks is proposed in this study. In the day-ahead dispatch model, generation units and a large-scale battery energy storage station (LS-BESS) are coordinated to participate in multi-type frequency control ancillary services (FCASs). For optimal performance, scheduling in different timescales and the complementarity between power and energy types of requirements are coordinated, with various service uncertainties considered. Then the conditional value-at-risk theory is utilized to achieve the optimal mix of multiple resources for day-ahead regulation reserves, to realize the minimum operation cost. To tackle the uncertainty of wind power over a large timescale, a robust optimization (RO) approach based on the budget uncertainty set is employed, which considers robustness and economy. This can help avoid over-conservation of the standard RO and enhance the applicability of the decisions made.

Detection of False Data Injection Attacks in Battery Stacks Using Input Noise-Aware Nonlinear State Estimation and Cumulative Sum Algorithms,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TIA.2023.3308548,"-Grid-scale battery energy storage systems (BESSs) are vulnerable to false data injection attacks (FDIAs), which could be used to disrupt state of charge (SoC) estimation. Inaccurate SoC estimation has negative impacts on system availability, reliability, safety, and the cost of operation. In this article a combination of a Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) algorithm and an improved input noise-aware extended Kalman filter (INAEKF) is proposed for the detection and identification of FDIAs in the voltage and current sensors of a battery stack. The series-connected stack is represented by equivalent circuit models, the SoC is modeled with a charge reservoir model and the states are estimated using the INAEKF. The root mean squared error of the states' estimation by the modified INAEKF was found to be superior to the traditional EKF. By employing the INAEKF, this article addresses the research gap that many state estimators make asymmetrical assumptions about the noise corrupting the system. Additionally, the INAEKF estimates the input allowing for the identification of FDIA, which many alternative methods are unable to achieve. The proposed algorithm was able to detect attacks in the voltage and current sensors in 99.16% of test cases, with no false positives.

Voltage Sensorless Based Model Predictive Control With Battery Management System: For Solar PV Powered On-Board EV Charging,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TTE.2022.3213253,"This work deals with a novel voltage sensorless based model predictive control (VSPC) scheme for continuous and quick maximum power harvesting (MPH) from a photovoltaic (PV) array for a solar-powered on-board electric vehicle (EV) charging system. In VSPC, the first model predictive control (MPC) is used with a PV array to predict the system state in the horizon of time and to eliminate the voltage sensor. An adaptive concept is used for deciding the operating point, which accelerates the tracking process and improves dynamic performance during irradiation changes and shading pattern changes in partially shaded conditions. Moreover, VSPC also takes care of the EV charging process using the EV -provided battery management system (BMS) command or threshold safety limits of the EV battery. The working principle of VSPC is based on a prediction of the future behavior of the system. It realizes on a selected time horizon, in an arbitrary number of samples, which is decided according to the complexity of the fitness function. In order to minimize or maximize the fitness function, it predicts the voltage of the solar PV array as well as tunes the present control signal, which forces it to converge or reach the convergence criteria. Moreover, the cost and response time of current sensors are lower than voltage sensors. Therefore, the VSPC control gives a fast response and low power oscillations in steady-state compared to conventional techniques. This control technique is verified on a developed prototype of the PV system in different shading and irradiance conditions, as well as the system stability, is analyzed through the Bode plot. The system performance is also compared with the state-of-the-art methods.",work deal novel voltage sensorless base model predictive control vspc scheme continuous quick maximum power harvesting mph photovoltaic pv array solarpowere onboard electric vehicle ev charge system vspc model predictive control mpc use pv array predict system state horizon time eliminate voltage sensor adaptive concept use decide operating point accelerate tracking process improve dynamic performance irradiation change shading pattern change partially shaded condition vspc care ev charge process use ev provide battery management system bms command threshold safety limit ev battery work principle vspc base prediction future behavior system realize select time horizon arbitrary number sample decide accord complexity fitness function order minimize maximize fitness function predict voltage solar pv array tune present control signal force converge reach convergence criterion cost response time current sensor low voltage sensor vspc control fast response low power oscillation steadystate compare conventional technique control technique verify develop prototype pv system different shading irradiance condition system stability analyze bode plot system performance compare stateoftheart method
Generation of green hydrogen using self-sustained regenerative fuel cells: Opportunities and challenges,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.03.430,"The ever-increasing energy demand, depleting fossil fuel reserves, and rising temperatures due to greenhouse gas emissions have necessitated the transition towards the generation of green and clean energy through renewable energy sources. Solar energy is one such renewable energy source that has received significant attention owing to its abundance and inexhaustibility. However, solar energy alone cannot replace fossil fuels in the energy portfolio. There exists a need to develop another clean energy source that can potentially act as an alternative to conventional fuels. Hydrogen proves to be an ideal candidate in this domain and can be sustainably generated by water electrolysis by powering the electrolyzer using solar energy. The hydrogen thus synthesized has net zero carbon emissions and is a suitable asset for decarbonizing the environment. This review encompasses the generation of hydrogen using PV-Electrolyzer systems and addresses the challenges associated with the same. Overcoming these drawbacks can ensure a strong position for hydrogen as an alternative fuel in the energy infrastructure. By employing electrolyzers that are fueled by renewable energy and then using that hydrogen to feed a fuel cell, this study aims to clarify the potential and constraints of producing green hydrogen.

The primary difficulties in extracting solar power is occurrence of partial shading which causes the panel to significantly increases power loss. These will mainly occur due to when partially shaded solar PV array kept under certain critical conditions for obtaining maximum output power. Many researcher have suggested by connecting bypass diodes in anti-parallel to the PV modules hotspots in the modules can be avoided. Out of all techniques, the proposed Bayesian Fusion Technique (BFT) is a hybrid optimization algorithm that combines the Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) and Flower Pollination Algorithm (FPA) techniques to optimize the performance of solar panels in photovoltaic (PV) systems.

An improved genetic algorithm based fractional open circuit voltage MPPT for solar PV systems,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.egyr.2022.12.088,"To extract the maximum power from solar PV, maximum power point tracking (MPPT) controllers are needed to operate the PV arrays at their maximum power point under varying environmental conditions. Fractional Open Circuit Voltage (FOCV) is a simple, cost-effective, and easy to implement MPPT technique. However, it suffers from the discontinuous power supply and low tracking efficiency. To overcome these drawbacks, a new hybrid MPPT technique based on the Genetic Algorithm (GA) and FOCV is proposed.

Techno-economic assessment of green hydrogen and ammonia production from wind and solar energy in Iran,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.12.285,"This paper presents a comprehensive technical and economic assessment of potential green hydrogen and ammonia production plants in different locations in Iran with strong wind and solar resources. The study was organized in five steps. First, regarding the wind density and solar PV potential data, three locations in Iran were chosen with the highest wind power, solar radiation, and a combination of both wind/solar energy. All these locations are inland spots, but since the produced ammonia is planned to be exported, it must be transported to the export harbor in the South of Iran. For comparison, a base case was also considered next to the export harbor with normal solar and wind potential, but no distance from the export harbor. In the second step, a similar large-scale hydrogen production facility with proton exchange membrane electrolyzers was modeled for all these locations using the HOMER Pro simulation platform. In the next step, the produced hydrogen and the nitrogen obtained from an air separation unit are supplied to a Haber-Bosch process to synthesize ammonia as a hydrogen carrier. Since water electrolysis requires a considerable amount of water with specific quality and because Iran suffers from water scarcity, this paper, unlike many similar research studies, addresses the challenges associated with the water supply system in the hydrogen production process. In this regard, in the fourth step of this study, it is assumed that seawater from the nearest sea is treated in a desalination plant and sent to the site locations. Finally, since this study intends to evaluate the possibility of green hydrogen export from Iran, a detailed piping model for the transportation of water, hydrogen, and ammonia from/to the production site and the export harbor is created in the last step, which considers the real routs using satellite images, and takes into account all pump/compression stations required to transport these media.

In this paper, a wind speed forecasting method based on improved empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and GA-BP neural network is proposed. EMD has been applied extensively for analyzing nonlinear stochastic signals. Ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) is an improved method of EMD, which can effectively handle the mode-mixing problem and decompose the original data into more stationary signals with different frequencies. Each signal is taken as an input data to the GA-BP neural network model. The final forecasted wind speed data is obtained by aggregating the predicted data of individual signals. Cases study of a wind farm in Inner Mongolia, China, shows that the proposed hybrid method is much more accurate than the traditional GA-BP forecasting approach and GA-BP with EMD and wavelet neural network method. By the sensitivity analysis of parameters, it can be seen that appropriate settings on parameters can improve the forecasting result.

Real-Time Energy Storage Management for Renewable Integration in Microgrid: An Off-Line Optimization Approach,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2014.2359004,"-Microgrid is a key enabling solution to future smart grids by integrating distributed renewable generators and storage systems to efficiently serve the local demand. However, due to the random and intermittent characteristics of renewable energy, new challenges arise for the reliable operation of microgrids. To address this issue, we study in this paper the real-time energy management for a single microgrid system that constitutes a renewable generation system, an energy storage system, and an aggregated load. We model the renewable energy offset by the load over time, termed net energy profile, to be practically predictable, but with finite errors that can be arbitrarily distributed. We aim to minimize the total energy cost (modeled as sum of time-varying strictly convex functions) of the conventional energy drawn from the main grid over a finite horizon by jointly optimizing the energy charged/discharged to/from the storage system over time subject to practical load and storage constraints. To solve this problem in real time, we propose a new off-line optimization approach to devise the online algorithm. In this approach, we first assume that the net energy profile is perfectly predicted or known ahead of time, under which we derive the optimal off-line energy scheduling solution in closedform. Next, inspired by the optimal off-line solution, we propose a sliding-window based online algorithm for real-time energy management under the practical setup of noisy predicted net energy profile with arbitrary errors.

Due to deficiency or unavailability of dispatchable energy recourses, only the nondispatchable renewable energy resources (wind and solar energy) are considered to supply the required energy. Applied strategy for effective component size optimization as well as relevant costs reduction is implemented by reducing or eliminating the mismatch between the generation and consumption profiles by time shift and schedule of dispatchable loads.

Hydrogen is injected into a gas network in a quantity and quality compatible with the gas safety regulations and thereby transported as a mixture of hydrogen and natural gas to demand centres. Once integrated into the electricity network, PtG systems can provide flexibility to the power system and absorb excess electricity from renewables to produce hydrogen. Injection of hydrogen into the gas network reduces gas volumes supplied from terminals. In order to investigate this concept, hydrogen electrolysers were included as a technology option within an operational optimisation model of the Great Britain (GB) combined gas and electricity network (CGEN). The model was used to determine the minimum cost of meeting the electricity and gas demand in a typical low and high electricity demand day in GB, in the presence of a significant capacity of wind generation. The value of employing power-to-gas systems in the gas and electricity supply system was investigated given different allowable levels of hydrogen injections. The results showed that producing hydrogen from electricity is capable of reducing wind curtailment in a high wind case and decreasing the overall cost of operating the GB gas and electricity network. The northern part of GB was identified as a suitable region to develop hydrogen electrolysis and injection facilities due to its vicinity to a significant capacity of wind generation, as well as the existence of gas network headroom capacity, which is expected to increase as a result of depletion of UK domestic gas resources.",powertogas ptg convert electricity hydrogen use electrolysis process use gas grid storage transport hydrogen hydrogen inject gas network quantity quality compatible gas safety regulation transport mixture hydrogen natural gas demand centre integrate electricity network ptg system provide flexibility power system absorb excess electricity renewable produce hydrogen injection hydrogen gas network reduce gas volume supply terminal order investigate concept hydrogen electrolyser include technology option operational optimisation model great britain gb combine gas electricity network cgen model use determine minimum cost meet electricity gas demand typical low high electricity demand day gb presence significant capacity wind generation value employ powertogas system gas electricity supply system investigate different allowable level hydrogen injection result produce hydrogen electricity capable reduce wind curtailment high wind case decrease overall cost operate gb gas electricity network northern gb identify suitable region develop hydrogen electrolysis injection facility vicinity significant capacity wind generation existence gas network headroom capacity expect increase result depletion uk domestic gas resource
Dealing with multiple decades of hourly wind and PV time series in energy models: A comparison of methods to reduce time resolution and the planning implications of inter-annual variability,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.03.051,"Using a high-resolution planning model of the Great Britain power system and 25 years of simulated wind and PV generation data, this study compares different methods to reduce time resolution of energy models to increase their computational tractability: downsampling, clustering, and heuristics. By comparing model results in terms of costs and installed capacities across different methods, this study shows that the best method depends heavily on input data and the setup of model constraints. This implies that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to the problem of time step reduction, but heuristic approaches appear promising. In addition, the 25 years of time series demonstrate considerable inter-year variability in wind and PV power output. This further complicates the problem of time detail in energy models as it suggests long time series are necessary. Model results with high shares of PV and wind generation using a single or few years of data are likely unreliable.

Over the period 2005_2013 an increase of 1 GWh in the hourly average of daily production from solar and wind sources has, on average, reduced wholesale electricity prices by respectively 2.3_/MWh and 4.2_/MWh and has amplified their volatility. The impact on prices has decreased over time in correspondence with the increase in solar and wind electricity production. We estimate that, over the period 2009_2013, solar production has generated higher monetary savings than wind production, mainly because the former is more prominent than the latter.

Enhancing resource efficiency through the utilization of the green bond market: An empirical analysis of Asian economies,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resourpol.2023.104623,"This research explores the effects of the green bonds market on resource efficiency across 12 actively involved Asian economies from 2015 to 2022. The empirical results indicate a positive connection between green bond issuance and resource efficiency, suggesting that a 1% increase in green bonds corresponds to significant short-term (0.33%) and long-term (0.43%) improvements. Surprisingly, a negative relationship is observed between GDP growth and resource efficiency, implying that economic expansion may contribute to heightened resource consumption. The study highlights the favorable impact of renewable power generation on resource efficiency, driven by the sustainability of renewable energy sources. Nevertheless, challenges arise from poverty ratios and consumer price indices, impeding the adoption of resource-efficient technology. Furthermore, while cell phone penetration initially benefits resource efficiency, a negative correlation emerges in the long term due to increased non-renewable energy consumption.

"Modeling the linkage between climate-tech, energy transition, and CO2 emissions: Do environmental regulations matter?",http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gr.2023.04.003,"a b s t r a c t The transition from conventional energy to clean energy is the ultimate strategy to reduce global CO2 emissions. In this regard, climate technologies (climate-tech) can pave the way toward achieving the capabilities required to promote alternative energy and energy saving. In addition, environmental regulations can support technological upgrading, energy transition, and emissions reduction to promote sustainable development. With this in view, this study investigates the impact of climate technologies (climate-tech) and energy transitions on CO2 emissions in the European Union (EU) member countries. Further, we examine the role of environmental regulation in the relationship between climate-tech, energy transition, and CO2 emissions. The empirical analysis is conducted based on international panel data for 26 EU countries ranging from 1994 to 2019, and the Common Correlated Effects Mean Group (CCE-MG) method is employed to estimate the coefficients of the variables. The outcomes of the analysis indicate that both climate-tech and energy transitions mitigate environmental degradation by reducing carbon emissions. Additionally, environmental regulations are found to be an effective monitoring and controlling tool that can significantly reduce CO2 emissions. Moreover, economic growth and urbanization as control variables contribute to increasing CO2 emissions, thus negatively affecting environmental sustainability. The causal analysis demonstrates that decision-making trends related to climate-tech, energy transition, and environmental regulations influence CO2 emissions. Conversely, strategies for coping with CO2 emissions and climate change will affect energy transitions and environmental regulations.

Tuning Mass Transport in Electrocatalysis Down to Sub-5 nm through Nanoscale Grade Separation,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/anie.202212653,"Nano and single-atom catalysis open new possibilities of producing green hydrogen (H2) by water electrolysis. However, for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) which occurs at a characteristic reaction rate proportional to the potential, the fast generation of H2 nanobubbles at atomic-scale interfaces often leads to the blockage of active sites. Herein, a nanoscale grade-separation strategy is proposed to tackle mass-transport problem by utilizing ordered threedimensional (3d) interconnected sub-5 nm pores.

Photocatalytic H2O2 production Systems: Design strategies and environmental applications,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2022.138489,"A B S T R A C T Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is an environmentally friendly versatile oxidant, which has been used in chemical industry, medical, energy, and environmental fields. Photocatalytic H2O2 production is a sustainable, safe, and green process; however, the high recombination of electron-hole pairs, low visible light utilization, and poor product selectivity still limit the practical applications of photocatalytic H2O2 production. Previous reviews on photocatalytic H2O2 generation focus more on the photocatalysts but less on the design strategy of the photocatalytic systems, which stems from the critical steps involving the photocatalytic process, i.e., light absorption, charge separation, and surface redox reaction. From this point of review, this review article introduces the strategies for improving the H2O2 production efficiency based on the above three critical processes.

Herein, an effective modification strategy is proposed by arming a sub_nanometer RuO2 skin with abundant oxygen vacancies to the interconnected Ru clusters/carbon hybrid microsheet (denoted as Ru@V_RuO2/C HMS), which can not only inherit the high hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of the Ru, but more importantly, activate the superior activity toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in both acid and alkaline conditions. Outstandingly, it can achieve an ultralow overpotential of 176/201 mV for OER and 46/6 mV for the HER to reach 10 mA cm_2 in acidic and alkaline solution, respectively.

Strategies to save energy in the context of the energy crisis: a review,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10311-023-01591-5,"New technologies, systems, societal organization and policies for energy saving are urgently needed in the context of accelerated climate change, the Ukraine conflict and the past coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. For instance, concerns about market and policy responses that could lead to new lock-ins, such as investing in liquefied natural gas infrastructure and using all available fossil fuels to compensate for Russian gas supply cuts, may hinder decarbonization efforts. Here we review energy-saving solutions with a focus on the actual energy crisis, green alternatives to fossil fuel heating, energy saving in buildings and transportation, artificial intelligence for sustainable energy, and implications for the environment and society. Green alternatives include biomass boilers and stoves, hybrid heat pumps, geothermal heating, solar thermal systems, solar photovoltaics systems into electric boilers, compressed natural gas and hydrogen. We also detail case studies in Germany which is planning a 100% renewable energy switch by 2050 and developing the storage of compressed air in China, with emphasis on technical and economic aspects.

Highly efficient adsorption and removal bio-staining dye from industrial wastewater onto mesoporous Ag-MOFs,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.psep.2023.02.036,"Adsorption is an effective and promising approach for removing pollutants from wastewater. Too many hazardous colors were unintentionally released into the water, which had a negative impact on the environment. A popular textile dye is malachite green (MG). Thus, in this work, an environmentally acceptable inorganic-organic Ag metal-organic framework-based technique to remove colors from industrial water was developed (Ag-MOF). The sorbent was analyzed in the first section of the work using SEM, XPS, XRD, FT-IR, pHpzc, and BET, which confirmed that the Ag-MOF had the BET surface area, is 676 m2/g, which is a significant surface area. In a later stage, the sorption properties of the dye were examined along with the effects of pH, sorbent dosage, temperature, and ionic strength; the sorption isotherms and uptake kinetics were examined: As opposed to the kinetic profile, Isotherm profiles are well-fit by the Langmuir equation and can be modeled by the pseudo-second order rate equation. The outcomes further demonstrated that MG was mostly adsorbed onto Ag-MOF adsorbent by electrostatic attraction forces, hydrogen bonding, ion exchange, and pore filling. 2.25 mmol/g was found to be the greatest adsorption effectiveness of MG onto Ag-MOF adsorbent. (i.e. 809.71 mg/g). Adsorbent dosage, solution pH, temperature, and time were the four adsorption process parameters that were tuned using Box-Behnken design (BBD) in response surface methodology (RSM). The (¦¤H¡ã), (¦¤S¡ã), and (¦¤G¡ã) MG dye was endothermically and spontaneously extracted using Ag-MOF as an adsorbent, according to the specifications. Up to five cycles of adsorption-desorption, the synthesised Ag-MOF adsorbent demonstrates exceptional render ability and cyclability. The produced adsorbent's efficacy for purifying wastewater samples at a laboratory scale was assessed as a proof of concept. Study the mechanism of interaction between the Ag-MOF and MG as it could be take place through ¦Ð-¦Ð interaction, pore filling, H-Bonding or electrostatic interaction. The mesoporous Ag-MOF adsorbent offered a simple and effective way to handle water filtering and industrial wastewater management.

Bacterial Growth-Induced Tobramycin Smart Release Self-Healing Hydrogel for Pseudomonas aeruginosa-Infected Burn Wound Healing,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.2c05557,"Burns are a common health problem worldwide and are highly susceptible to bacterial infections that are dificult to handle with ordinary wound dressings. Therefore, burn wound repair is extremely challenging in clinical practice. Herein, a series of self-healing hydrogels (QCS/OD/TOB/PPY@PDA) with good electrical conductivity and antioxidant activity were prepared on the basis of quaternized chitosan (QCS), oxidized dextran (OD), tobramycin (TOB), and polydopaminecoated polypyrrole nanowires (PPY@PDA NWs). These Schif base crosslinks between the aminoglycoside antibiotic TOB and OD enable TOB to be slowly released and responsive to pH. Interestingly, the acidic substances during the bacteria growth process can induce the on-demand release of TOB, avoiding the abuse of antibiotics. The antibacterial results showed that the QCS/OD/TOB/PPY@PDA9 hydrogel could kill high concentrations of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA), Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli in a short time and showed a bactericidal efect for up to 11 days in an agar plate difusion experiment, while showing good in vivo antibacterial activity. Excellent and long-lasting antibacterial properties make it suitable for severely infected wounds. Furthermore, the incorporation of PPY@PDA endowed the hydrogel with near-infrared (NIR) irradiation assisted bactericidal activity of drug-resistant bacteria, conductivity, and antioxidant activity. Most importantly, in the PA-infected burn wound model, the QCS/OD/TOB/PPY@PDA9 hydrogel more efectively controlled wound inflammation levels and promoted collagen deposition, vascular generation, and earlier wound closure compared to Tegaderm dressings.

The economics and the environmental benignity of different colors of hydrogen,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.02.094,"Due to the increasing greenhouse gas emissions, as well as due to the rapidly increasing use of renewable energy sources in the electricity generation over the last years, interest in hydrogen is rising again. Hydrogen can be used as a storage for renewable energy balancing the whole energy systems, and contributing to the decarbonization of the energy system, especially of the industry and the transport sector. The major objective of this paper is to discuss various ways of hydrogen production depending on the primary energy sources used. Moreover, the economic and environmental performance of three major hydrogen colors, as well as major barriers for faster deployment in fuel cell vehicles, are analyzed. The major conclusion is that the full environmental benefits of hydrogen use are highly dependent on the hydrogen production methods and primary sources used. Only green hydrogen with electricity from wind, PV and hydro has truly low emissions. All other sources like blue hydrogen with CCUS or electrolysis using the electricity grid have substantially higher emissions, coming close to grey hydrogen production. Another conclusion is that it is important to introduce an international market for hydrogen to lower costs and to produce hydrogen where conditions are best. Finally, the major open question remaining is whether _ including all external costs of all energy carriers, hydrogen of any color may become economically competitive in any sector of the energy system. The future success of hydrogen is very dependent on technological development and resulting cost reductions, as well as on future priorities and the corresponding policy framework.

Optimal economic scheduling of microgrids considering renewable energy sources based on energy hub model using demand response and improved water wave optimization algorithm,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.est.2022.105311,"Unpredictable nature of renewable energy sources puts power system operators in different conditions in terms of maintaining the system reliability. Microgrids (MGs) can provide an effective solution for the problems of grid-connected renewable energy sources due to their tuning capability and flexibility. In this study, a stochastic optimization strategy was proposed for participating in energy market operations considering demand response (DR). The results indicated the operating cost decreased when the MG implemented DR programs. Also, DR program could shift energy consumption from on- to off-peak hours and flatten the load curve. Therefore, a scheduling model was presented for the operation of energy carriers and reserves considering security constraints of power and natural gas grids in interconnected hubs as well as responsive load participation using the developed water wave optimization (WWO) algorithm. The objective function of this model aimed to minimize the operating cost of sources to supply electrical and thermal loads applied to the proposed MG. WWO is a meta-heuristic algorithm inspired by the behavior of water waves. The waves formed on the sea surface have complex, but interesting, relationships that can be used to solve optimization problems. In this algorithm, each problem solution is encoded as a water wave and undergoes changes in the problem search space based on three behaviors of propagation, refraction, and decay of water waves or problem solutions. The simplicity of the structure of this method, elitism and the ability to escape from local points due to the existence of different search operators and the mutation of generations have led to the use of this method. The results indicated a decline in operating costs through electrical and thermal responsive load participation and thermal energy storage system.

Semi-supervised adversarial discriminative learning approach for intelligent fault diagnosis of wind turbine,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ins.2023.119496,"A B S T R A C T Wind turbines play a crucial role in renewable energy generation systems and are frequently exposed to challenging operational environments. Monitoring and diagnosing potential faults during their operation is essential for improving reliability and reducing maintenance costs. Supervised learning using data-driven techniques, particularly deep learning, offers a viable approach for developing fault diagnosis models. However, a significant challenge in practical wind power equipment lies in the scarcity of annotated samples required to train these models effectively. This paper proposes a semi-supervised fault diagnosis approach specifically designed for wind turbines, aiming to address this challenge. Initially, a semi-supervised deep neural network is constructed using adversarial learning, where a limited set of annotated samples is used in conjunction with a vast amount of unannotated samples. The health status features present in the unannotated samples are leveraged to capture a generalized representation of the underlying features. Subsequently, a metric learning-guided discriminative features enhancement technique is employed to improve the separability of different manifolds, thereby enhancing the performance of the semi-supervised training process. By employing this methodology, it becomes possible to develop a fault diagnosis model with superior accuracy using only a limited amount of annotated samples. Comprehensive fault diagnosis experiments were conducted on a wind turbine fault dataset, revealing the efficacy and superiority of the presented methodology.",b s t r c t wind turbine play crucial role renewable energy generation system frequently expose challenge operational environment monitor diagnose potential fault operation essential improve reliability reduce maintenance cost supervise learn use datadriven technique particularly deep learning offer viable approach develop fault diagnosis model significant challenge practical wind power equipment lie scarcity annotate sample require train model effectively paper propose semisupervise fault diagnosis approach specifically design wind turbine aim address challenge initially semisupervise deep neural network construct use adversarial learning limit set annotate sample use conjunction vast unannotated sample health status feature present unannotated sample leveraged capture generalize representation underlie feature subsequently metric learningguided discriminative feature enhancement technique employ improve separability different manifold enhance performance semisupervise training process employ methodology possible develop fault diagnosis model superior accuracy use limit annotated sample comprehensive fault diagnosis experiment conduct wind turbine fault dataset reveal efficacy superiority present methodology
Model Predictive Current Control of Nine-Phase Open-End Winding PMSMs With an Online Virtual Vector Synthesis Strategy,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2022.3174241,"The current error is hard to avoid for finite control set model predictive current control (FCS-MPCC) in nine-phase open-end winding permanent magnet synchronous motors. To overcome this problem, an online virtual voltage vector (V  ) synthesis strategy is proposed in this article. First, a group of V  s without harmonic voltage components are designed as the basic vectors for online synthesis. Then, two adjacent basic V  s and a zero vector are used to synthesize a new V  , which can output arbitrary amplitude and phase angle in the fundamental space. The two basic V  s are directly selected from the located sector of the predicted reference voltage vector (RVV), and their duration ratio can be simply calculated according to the angle of the RVV in the sector. In this way, the zero error is realized between the new V  and RVV. Moreover, an online pulse generation algorithm corresponding to the new V  is proposed, which can calculate the symmetrical pulse sequences in real-time for the multiphase OW drive system without the space vector modulator. Finally, experimental results have verified the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed strategy, in comparison to existing FCS-MPCC in multiphase OW motor drive systems.",current error hard avoid finite control set model predictive current control fcsmpcc ninephase openend wind permanent magnet synchronous motor overcome problem online virtual voltage vector v synthesis strategy propose article group v s harmonic voltage component design basic vector online synthesis adjacent basic v s zero vector use synthesize new v output arbitrary amplitude phase angle fundamental space basic v s directly select locate sector predict reference voltage vector rvv duration ratio simply calculate accord angle rvv sector way zero error realize new v rvv online pulse generation algorithm correspond new v propose calculate symmetrical pulse sequence realtime multiphase ow drive system space vector modulator finally experimental result verify effectiveness superiority propose strategy comparison exist fcsmpcc multiphase ow motor drive system
"Risk-constrained stochastic scheduling for energy hub: Integrating renewables, demand response, and electric vehicles",http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2023.129680,"This research introduces a stochastic scheduling approach that incorporates risk constraints for an energy hub (EH), considering uncertainties related to renewable generation and load demands. The proposed method utilizes the Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) technique to assess and quantify risks. By striking a balance between reducing operational and emissions costs and increasing risk aversion, the approach presents a trade-off. The EH comprises various components such as a wind turbine (WT), photovoltaic (PV) cells, a fuel cell power plant (FCPP), a combined heat and power generation unit (CHP), and plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs). Uncertain variables encompass factors such as wind speed, solar irradiation, different demands, and market prices. To optimize profits and enhance the consumption curve, demand response programs (DRPs) for electrical, thermal, and cooling demands are implemented. To address the uncertainties associated with input random variables, the efficient k-means data clustering method is employed. A new slime mold algorithm, based on coughing and chaos theory, has been proposed to enhance the problem's solution. The algorithm incorporates innovative operators to improve its capabilities. By utilizing the coughing mechanism and chaos theory, the algorithm explores the solution space more effectively, resulting in improved outcomes for the problem at hand. The results demonstrate significant flexibility in EH management and are extensively discussed. Simulation results indicate that integrating PEVs, FCPP, and DRPs can lead to reductions of 2 %, 7 %, and 11 % in the EH's operating costs, respectively. Furthermore, considering PEVs, FCPP, and DRPs can improve the EH's risk cost by 1.98 %, 6.7 %, and 10.5 %, respectively. Based on the numerical results, in Case 4 led to a remarkable 12.65 % reduction in operational costs while simultaneously achieving a 15.43 % decrease in emission costs, showcasing the effectiveness of the proposed approach in optimizing energy management in an energy hub system.",research introduce stochastic scheduling approach incorporate risk constraint energy hub eh consider uncertainty relate renewable generation load demand propose method utilize conditional value risk cvar technique assess quantify risk strike balance reduce operational emission cost increase risk aversion approach present tradeoff eh comprise component wind turbine wt photovoltaic pv cell fuel cell power plant fcpp combine heat power generation unit chp plugin electric vehicle pev uncertain variable encompass factor wind speed solar irradiation different demand market price optimize profit enhance consumption curve demand response program drps electrical thermal cool demand implement address uncertainty associate input random variable efficient kmean datum clustering method employ new slime mold algorithm base cough chaos theory propose enhance problem solution algorithm incorporate innovative operator improve capability utilize cough mechanism chaos theory algorithm explore solution space effectively result improve outcome problem hand result demonstrate significant flexibility eh management extensively discuss simulation result indicate integrate pevs fcpp drps lead reduction 2 7 11 ehs operating cost respectively furthermore consider pevs fcpp drps improve ehs risk cost 198 67 105 respectively base numerical result case 4 lead remarkable 1265 reduction operational cost simultaneously achieve 1543 decrease emission cost showcase effectiveness propose approach optimize energy management energy hub system
